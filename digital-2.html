      <h2>Love is Blind + Butter</h2>
      <ul>

	<li><strong>High Concept:</strong> One player seeks the piece
	  of toast while blindfolded, the other players try to help
	  them find it.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> Players will
	  have fun and grow closer by pursuing a common goal while
	  having unequal access to information.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
	  A platformer with analog and digital components.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Game play:</strong> This game is a platformer, so
	  the player needs to jump onto platforms. If they miss, they
	  will fall to their death. The cursor keys control left and
	  right motion, the spacebar makes the player jump. The goal
	  of the game is to touch the piece of toast. The player with
	  access to the keyboard must wear a blindfold during play.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong> My goal with this
	  prototype is to explore cooperation between players who have
	  unequal amounts of information. I also wanted to make a game
	  that a 40 person class could participate in.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Features:</strong>
	  This game can be played by two to about one hundred players.
	  It features authentic blindness mechanics.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong> You are a stick of
	butter, and you love a piece of toast. But, you have no eyes.
	You'll have to rely on your friends to lead you to your
	beloved toast.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Story:</strong>
	  Maybe a love triangle with a jar of jam in the sequel?
	</li>

	<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> My target audience is
	  casual players who are looking to socialize with a group
	  game. I am also specifically gearing this towards
	  presentation in front of a class.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
	  About three minutes.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> Players who aren't wearing
	  the blindfold will need to coordinate the information that
	  they're giving so that the blindfolded player won't be
	  overwhelmed. The blindfolded player will need to choose
	  which voices they want to base their decisions on, probably
	  using prior information about the other players.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> All of the visual
	  assets are handmade. The sound assets were taken from the
	  Phaser examples. The platforming code was based on a Phaser
	  example.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> The most
	  similar game is the platforming Phaser example on
	  Photonstorm's website.
	</li>

    <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Two players compete to navigate a maze using gravity.</li>

    <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> Players will have
    fun trying to compete with asymmetrical starting conditions.</li>

    <li><strong>Genre:</strong>Two player maze.</li>

    <li><strong>Game play:</strong> One player controls a
    phone-stealing demon, the other player chases it, trying to
    retrieve their phone.</li>

    <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong> To make a solid functional
    game with two players.</li>

    <li><strong>Features:</strong> Features a complex map and
    two-player same-screen action.</li>

    <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong> A demon has stolen your cellphone. Alternatively, you are a demon who has just stolen a cell phone.</li>

    <li><strong>Story:</strong> This game doesn't have an overarching
    story, but it is suggestive. Satanic technochratic cultists? It
    bears further development.</li>

    <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> People who want to play a
    collaborative game with a friend.</li>

    <li><strong>Play time:</strong> About 3 minutes.</li>

    <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> There unfortunately isn't too
      much in the way of strategies or meaninful decisions as far as I
      can see.</li>

    <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>They are all from OpenGameArt.</li>

    <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> It's similar to
      the toy where you have a marble in a wooden maze and you have to
      navigate through it by tilting the box. The physical game gives
      you much more fine-grained control, though, which is a problem
      with this game.</li>

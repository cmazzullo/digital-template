<h2>The Dogcatcher of Memories</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect as much food as possible in 30 seconds, without getting caught.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> I want players to feel a
mixture of panic and compassion towards the protagonist, a hungry
stray, while quickly running out of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a timed version of a turn- and tile-based game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
  A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

The core mechanic is the quest for food, which the player has to dig
for. Hunger is the main resource - in the prototype it's called Time,
but I'd like to change it to a slowly depleting food meter. The player
can look for food by digging, or move to an adjacent square. Every
time the player takes three actions, either moving or digging, the
dogcatchers move one square closer. The inputs are the cursor keys,
for movement, and the spacebar, for digging.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong> This prototype is evaluating the
hunger mechanic: a resource is rapidly depleting, forcing the player
to make quick decisions.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
  The combination of turn-based and timed gameplay.
  The fast pace of player actions.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong> You are a stray dog, and are
extremely hungry. You need to dig up as much food as possible to keep
from starving. All the while, you're chased by dog catchers. The white
and black blob is the dog, the blue circles are dog catchers.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong> The game doesn't have an overarching story
right now, but I'd like to add one in future revisions. The story
would involve a reunion with a loving owner, who turns out to be the
head of the neighborhood Dogcatcher's Association, leading to a
climactic boss fight.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> I'm aiming for people who don't
have much time to play a game but want to kill a few minutes with
something fast-paced.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Thirty seconds, max.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> Moving and picking things up as fast
as possible. Staying away from the corners of the map can help stop
dogcatchers from pinning you in.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> I took the fruit images from
the "Matching Pairs" program on the Phaser Examples page. All of the
other assets are original.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> I borrowed heavily
from the phaser example "Matching Pairs" for the code, but the game
most resembles the traditional game "Hare and Hounds," where three
Hounds try to chase down a Hare on a chess board.

# An ancient and embarassing repository of mandatory games

Dear GitHub reader, you have come upon a repository of very bad games.

In 2015 I signed up for a game design course to fulfill the requirements for a Computer Science minor,
while finishing up a Physics batchelor's. The semester ended up being pretty demanding, and the game
design course mandated one game submission per week.

Behold the shittacular results here http://cmazzullo.github.io/digital-template/

IF YOU DARE
